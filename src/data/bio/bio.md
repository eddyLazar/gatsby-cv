I am seasoned developer with 10 years of full stack experience. I've been working in different areas and with different technologies. I'm passionate about my work if it's interesting. I like architecting new things. I'm always keen on learning and exploring something new also ready to help others if needed. Excited about exchanging and discussing new ideas with others.
