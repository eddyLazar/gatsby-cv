Worked on intergration of 3d models from [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) with web interfaces on React.

We had a lot of small web projects with 3d integrations I was responsible for building a workflow and tools(js library, react components) to optimize these projects lifecycle for me and the rest of the team.
